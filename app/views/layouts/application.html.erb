    # Originally, I did not have a "shared" folder, 
    # but after (attempting) troubleshooting why my "render" statement as specified in
    # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials,
    # was not working for over two hours, I was following the video at
    # https://gorails.com/episodes/rails-for-beginners-part-8-using-partials-for-the-navbar,
    # creating a shared folder as specâ€” and that's when I spotted it, taunting me: the missing '=' in '<%='.
    # All my suffering was due to something as simple as a syntax error!
    # I am very annoyed as I hadn't made a syntax error that took this long to debug 
    # in at least a couple years! Of course, when I added the missing '=', 
    # the navbar worked immediately, but I decided to keep the 'shared' folder
    # because it makes more sense to have a partial view that is rendered in many/all 
    # layouts in a separate folder under 'views/' than 'views/layouts' since 
    # views and layouts serve different purposes and 'shared/_navbar.html.erb' is 
    # a (partial) view, not a layout.
